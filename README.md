# Pyka
Personal Project to actualize the game Pyka.

The game pyka was introduced me by a coworker in 2019, and I've now decided to make it due to the popularity of a simmilar game Wordle.

Rules of Pyka
1. Both Players have a 4 digit, non-repeating, number, and the aim is to guess the opponents number.
2. Players take turn guessing 4 digit, non-repeating, numbers. They will be told that they got a certain amount of 'pyka' and 'centra'. Pyka means that they got the right number, but in the wrong spot. Centra means that they got the right number in the right spot. The player won't be told exactly which number is the pyka and centra.
3. The game concludes when one player guesses the opponents number and scores a '4 centra'.

The goal of this project is to make this game playable online between two real players.
